 * `CallHandler` is the main workhorse. It intercepts all calls and performs necessary actions
 * like registering a stub, performing actions on a specific stub, recording a call, verifying a call as well as
 * returning arguments passed to a specific method call. Each action performed depends on the current state of the
 * call handler which defaults to None. The mock interface interacts with the call handler to set this state.
